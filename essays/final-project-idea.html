<p>By Sam Reed, Bibiana Garcia, Princess Rose Balasico, Omar Zaidi, Heinrich M</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>In an age when the environment demands our utmost attention, the management of marine debris has become an imperative task. Various organizations and individuals have recognized the need to streamline their efforts in detecting, removing, and responsibly disposing of debris in our oceans. The current scenario, however, reveals a lack of efficient communication among these entities and a scarcity of mechanisms to record and report data on debris removal. This essay explores the proposal for a comprehensive Centralized Database and Dispatch System, emphasizing real-time public access, effective dispatch communication tools, and a holistic database that captures data at all seven stages of debris management.</p>

<h2 id="centralized-database-and-dispatch-system">Centralized Database and Dispatch System</h2>

<h3 id="real-time-public-access">Real-Time Public-Access</h3>

<p>The heart of this system is a centralized database accessible in real-time by the public. This database serves as a reservoir of information, allowing civilians and debris removal organizations to seamlessly interact with each other and contribute to a cleaner environment.</p>

<h3 id="dispatch-communication-tools">Dispatch Communication Tools</h3>

<p>Efficient communication is the cornerstone of this system. It enables organizations to receive and act upon reports swiftly, minimizing response times and maximizing debris removal efficiency. The system includes a hotline, a user-friendly website, and a mobile application for easy reporting.</p>

<h3 id="comprehensive-data-collection">Comprehensive Data Collection</h3>

<p>The cradle-to-grave database captures information at all seven steps of debris management, ensuring that no crucial data is lost in the process. The database tracks debris amounts and proportions by mapped location, removal efficiency, debris type, polymer type, and disposal mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="quantifying-debris-removal">Quantifying Debris Removal</h2>

<p>To measure the effectiveness of debris removal efforts, a robust database is indispensable. This database collects information from the initial detection of debris in the ocean to its removal, including assessments of debris types and disposal/recycling choices.</p>

<h2 id="the-need-for-better-communication">The Need for Better Communication</h2>

<p>It is evident that several organizations exist to remove debris, but their efficacy is hindered by a lack of communication and follow-up. Moreover, the absence of a system to record debris type and amount creates a significant knowledge gap. Therefore, a flexible platform is essential not only for efficient coordination among organizations but also for engaging local communities in this environmental cause.</p>

<h2 id="user-friendly-interface">User-Friendly Interface</h2>

<h3 id="civilian-user-side">Civilian User Side</h3>

<p>The platform offers a user-friendly interface for civilians to report debris. Key features include the ability to specify whether the debris is on land or in the water, share coordinates, and attach photos. Civilians have the choice to create a profile or report anonymously. An option for a call-back number is available for registered users, facilitating contact by authorities. To avoid repetitive submissions, the system identifies if the reported debris matches a previous report and suggests the possibility of adding comments or additional information.</p>

<h3 id="debris-pick-up-organizations-side">Debris Pick-Up Organizations Side</h3>

<p>For debris pick-up organizations, the system allows for user creation with the option to choose to create an organization or work under an existing one. Organizations have special privileges, such as viewing a list of reported debris and claiming unresolved cases. They must adhere to specific timelines for debris pick-up, with a backup option in case the primary pick-up falls through. Organizations are also responsible for updating the system with information about the debris, including weight, size, type, and location.</p>

<h2 id="data-management">Data Management</h2>

<p>The database keeps track of reported debris in three categories: unresolved, claimed, and resolved. Users and organizations access these lists through the website/app. These lists are updated using a combination of manual inputs and importing data from Google Sheets. To ensure data integrity, a text sheet stores all data locally in case of connectivity issues with the Google Sheets platform.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The proposed Centralized Database and Dispatch System provides a comprehensive solution to the challenges of marine debris management. By enabling real-time public access, enhancing communication among stakeholders, and systematically collecting data at every stage of debris management, this system can be a game-changer in our efforts to protect the environment. It empowers both civilians and debris removal organizations to join forces and work together towards a cleaner, healthier planet.</p>
