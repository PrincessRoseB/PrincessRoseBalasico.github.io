## Introduction
Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly changing education, particularly in software engineering. The worth of it comes from its capacity to improve possibilities for learning, provide specific therapy, and support problem-solving. I have used ChatGPT and other AI tools in ICS 314 to help me with different facets of software development. ChatGPT has proven to be a handy tool, helping with everything from coding webpages and error troubleshooting to setting up databases such as MongoDB. The application of AI in this educational context highlights how it can enhance typical teaching strategies by offering students individualized support and direction as they work through the complexities of software engineering ideas and procedures.

## Personal Experience with AI:

### Experience WODs
E41: Experience the MongoDB Shell: 

When I ran into problems installing MongoDB on my server, I turned to ChatGPT. The ChatGPT gave me precise, easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions, but I still had trouble understanding the entire procedure. As a result, I found it difficult to understand the basic issues and the causes of errors when they occurred.

### In-class Practice WODs
For a class work of the day (WOD) that involved building the Murphy's Bar and Grill website, I used the ChatGPT. I clearly remember that I needed assistance using CSS to style the webpage, and the ChatGPT was useful in helping me to accomplish this. In particular, it helped me add their iconic photo as the backdrop, which functions as a base element. There were issues with the navigation bar (navbar), too, and the ChatGPT helped out with that part of the project.

### In-class WODs
When I ran into problems with Buzz's webpage, ChatGPT was very helpful, especially in making sure the background image filled the entire page. I also asked the ChatGPT for help in improving the footer by fixing things like incorrect color and chaotic link formats.

### Essays

E10: Reflect on Javascript1: Since I didn't know how to expand and organize my statements to fit the format of an essay, I found myself relying on ChatGPT. Facing difficulties in effectively extending my sentences and structuring them logically, I turned to ChatGPT for advice and insights to improve the overall composition and organization of my essay.

### Final Project
As we were wrapping up our final project, I didn't feel like I needed to rely on ChatGPT for help. The main reason for this lack of reliance was that the project was done in a group environment, which required collaboration. When I needed direction or explanation, I simply talked to my project partners, and we had open dialogue to answer questions and work through difficulties together. This cooperative strategy created an atmosphere where team members could draw on their specialized knowledge, guaranteeing a comprehensive comprehension and efficient handling of any issues about the project.


### Learning a concept 
In an attempt to improve my command prompt/terminal skills, I turned to watching educational YouTube videos.

The tutorials helped me understand the nuances of terminal commands and gave me useful advice on how to monitor the overall health of my software. This proved especially helpful when installing new databases, like nvm, npm, and node, as having an in-depth understanding of terminal operations made the process go more smoothly and intelligently.

### Answering a question in class or Discord
Throughout my course engagement, I did not have the chance to use AI to answer questions in class or on Discord. This was mostly caused by the fact that I was unable to respond to questions that classmates or peers asked, especially on the group chat app Discord. As such, the lack of these interactive scenarios restricted my interaction with AI in a Q&A setting. If the chance to actively participate and share knowledge within academia develops in the future, I'm still open to using AI in situations similar to this one.

### Asking or answering a smart question
I am not familiar with the application of ChatGPTs for creating or answering intelligent questions. When questions come up and the assignment seems to lean more toward the classification of a possibly complex or complex question, my first instinct has been to ask teaching assistants (TAs) for advice directly. This inclination arises from an intentional decision to make sure that the questions asked are in line with the subtle and intricate facets of the topic under discussion, rather than possibly labeling them as simpler or "dumb" questions. In the future, I'm willing to investigate how ChatGPTs might be used to respond to questions of different levels of difficulty to provide a more thorough and varied method of problem-solving and information gathering.

### Coding Example
I conversed with the chatbot to get advice on how to incorporate the style.css file and create the best possible layout for a project. My goal was to gain knowledge about the best practices for positioning particular colors and images within the design. I took advice from the chatbot on how to better comprehend the complex interactions between HTML structure and CSS styling, as well as how to strategically arrange visual elements to improve the webpage's overall usability and aesthetic appeal. Its collaborative involvement with the chatbot enabled an improved way of approaching design considerations, which added to a more thorough understanding of the beneficial relationship between HTML and CSS in web development.

### Explaining code
E14: Jamba Juice 3: Implement stock and a store: I was in a position where I needed help to clarify the JavaScript format for inventory checking in relation to a particular project. The complexity was not only comprehending the code's functional features but also exploring the reasoning behind using several classes in the layout. My question went beyond simple syntax placement; I wanted to understand the underlying ideas that made using multiple classes necessary for efficient inventory management. Through pursuing elucidation of these complex elements, I aimed to develop a comprehensive comprehension of JavaScript implementation, demonstrating its significance for both functionality and the layout's organizational structure. 

### Writing code
I used ChatGPT to expedite and improve my coding efforts while creating a webpage based on an existing design. ChatGPT was very helpful in this collaborative interaction because it gave me the HTML code and the matching style.css code. Making use of the tools available on the platform, I looked for both code fragments and insights into the structural and stylistic components that would best convey the spirit of the inspiration webpage. In addition to speeding up the coding process, ChatGPT's assistance promoted a greater awareness of the behind design principles, which enhanced the web developer's skill set.

### Documenting code
In my coding practices, I did not make extensive use of chatbots for code documentation. This was driven by an intentional choice to disregard personal approaches and choose for more traditional techniques when it came to the essential part of code documentation. Although I was aware of the potential advantages of AI in performing some documentation tasks, I chose to take a more typical approach, using platforms and manual documentation techniques to guarantee an organized and customized approach to explaining the nuances of the codebase. I'm still willing to investigate the possibility of incorporating AI into code documentation going forward, given the efficiency and accuracy benefits it may provide.

### Quality assurancce 
During different stages of my coding projects, from E41-related challenges to the complexities of setting up the final project, I often relied on ChatGPT to interpret and understand the error messages coming from the terminal.
