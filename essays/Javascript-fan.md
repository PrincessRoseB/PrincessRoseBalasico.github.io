*Difficulty: a thing that is hard to accomplish, deal with, or understand.*
## To start off...

I didn’t really know about this language since I thought a class will continue using only Java. 

What helped me understand it was free courses to learn from such as code academy and Freecodeacademy. 

What was interesting is that they aren’t so different as it was little tweaks of cleaning the code to import it for the web. 

Overall, I do prefer Javascript than Java, unless these free courses have more activities to do that I’ve not yet heard of. 


## Respecting ES6

Since I am a newbie, ES6 has made it simpler for me to input specific instructions to a task that can be accomplished in one line or two. 

I have learned how to rewrite a function with very few characters in addition to creating a variable within the same line. Even learning on how to “promise” which is like a

boolean effect on accomplishing a task or not to go forward with it. Although learning a new language or completely understanding a new update could’ve taken a month or so but it has taken me a few days to grasp this knowledge. 

Truth be told, it is not an instinct to where I have memorized everything but the basic concepts of it.

## In the context of engineering

WODs stands for “Workout of the Day(s)” giving real life coding situations and hopefully having a code that can successfully run with no errors. These are given every week and it is our choice 

to have the chance to do more than one. However, as I am putting my feet in the water for the first time, I’ll be doing WODs assignments every day trying to create codes (in Javascript) in order to be gaining experiences 

when I am setting off my career in an industry. They are especially helpful as it is also time sensitive where it shouldn’t last either 10 min or 15 min in finishing the code.

In my first experience in a practice WODs, I was a deer in headlights for the first 5 min and the panic began to rise as time was running out but hey, the first experience could be painful and rough but it is better than not touching the experience and having your first time in a real life situation. 

I have gotten used to the time and strategy in partaking in a WOD. Feeling towards a real one I should say I am not excited but accepting the outcome.
