<p>E41: Experience the MongoDB Shell:</p>

<p>When I ran into problems installing MongoDB on my server, I turned to ChatGPT. The ChatGPT gave me precise, easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions, but I still had trouble understanding the entire procedure. As a result, I found it difficult to understand the basic issues and the causes of errors when they occurred.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-practice-wods">In-class Practice WODs</h3>
<p>For a class work of the day (WOD) that involved building the Murphy’s Bar and Grill website, I used the ChatGPT. I clearly remember that I needed assistance using CSS to style the webpage, and the ChatGPT was useful in helping me to accomplish this. In particular, it helped me add their iconic photo as the backdrop, which functions as a base element. There were issues with the navigation bar (navbar), too, and the ChatGPT helped out with that part of the project.</p>

<h3 id="in-class-wods">In-class WODs</h3>
<p>When I ran into problems with Buzz’s webpage, ChatGPT was very helpful, especially in making sure the background image filled the entire page. I also asked the ChatGPT for help in improving the footer by fixing things like incorrect color and chaotic link formats.</p>

<h3 id="essays">Essays</h3>

<p>E10: Reflect on Javascript1: Since I didn’t know how to expand and organize my statements to fit the format of an essay, I found myself relying on ChatGPT. Facing difficulties in effectively extending my sentences and structuring them logically, I turned to ChatGPT for advice and insights to improve the overall composition and organization of my essay.</p>

<h3 id="final-project">Final Project</h3>
<p>As we were wrapping up our final project, I didn’t feel like I needed to rely on ChatGPT for help. The main reason for this lack of reliance was that the project was done in a group environment, which required collaboration. When I needed direction or explanation, I simply talked to my project partners, and we had open dialogue to answer questions and work through difficulties together. This cooperative strategy created an atmosphere where team members could draw on their specialized knowledge, guaranteeing a comprehensive comprehension and efficient handling of any issues about the project.</p>
