## Asking SMART,for a friend
Asking technical questions effectively and professionally within the hacker and open-source community needs to be appropriate. In other words, being a loser who is not 
handling their words appropriately could give you no answer at all. Providing thought-provoking questions makes hackers enjoy challenging problems that will also help them learn and solve 
complex issues. Here’s how you ask; make sure you’ve done your research before asking anybody and by that, find it in similar situations or FAQs or a simple Google search. The next step is
when you realize you can not find the answer anywhere, therefore you prepare yourself and ask the specific question. Take time to formulate your question thoughtfully and avoid hast, poorly 
formulated questions. Clearly state what you’ve done and what you’ve learned from your research. Being respectful gives you a higher chance of getting an answer. However, what if you’ve
gotten your answer? What to do with that cooperation? It may be a quick answer, but still, acknowledge the person’s time, and effort who answered your questions. 

## Stupid Questions
Stupid (loser) questions consist of inappropriate titles of “PLEASE HELP”  or “What is X can I fix it?”. Equipping that with a story of how you got in this situation goes something like,
“I don't know what happened” or “Does anyone know what this is?” isn't appropriate at all. As with Smart questions, the title should be the topic from what source or the actual problem that 
needs to be solved. The story of the problem should be a summary of how you either evolved into the situation or what you had done to fix it ( like storytelling).

## Sample of SMART
An example of a SMART question comes from Stack Overflow. This question correlates a rejection of a UDP message from the Golang server to an Android app. This person showed images of his code
but with summaries behind it. They continued research on their own and got no such luck as well as adding a side note calling it; “UPDATE”. I believe this example is a smart question due to 
the trial and error they’ve encountered and the research that they had done during and before asking these questions. Including acknowledging the person had given them a solution and working 
this way around them.

## Sample of stupid
For a stupid question, an example I found was this person trying to solve a code that gets the 8th string character to the last string character. What's been provided was an image of the code 
with no story and how they tried to fix it and show the error as a text. This question is ultimately not a question as they wanted someone to answer their homework problem (which they included 
that it is a school project). They missed the guidelines of being disrespectful and not making the effort to acknowledge someone who could answer them.
