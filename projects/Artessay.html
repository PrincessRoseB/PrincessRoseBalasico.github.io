  <h1 class="display-4">Concept of Art</h1>
 <p><strong><em>Third of May 1808</em></strong> by the artist Fransico de Goya is one of the most famous painting that 
essence my essays subjectively and objectively. 
Subjective in art is the technique and inspiration of how an artist put together a masterpiece. 
Objective in art is the history and ananlogy of what the artist want and not now want to show the audience.</p>

<p>This painting is based off a battle in Spain in May 2, 1808 and it depicted as if you are in the 
painting capturing the reality at that time. For example, two of my essays is broken down to (1) materials and colors that
encapsulate the moment of the tragedy and the symbolism of acceptance emulating from the people in the painting to 
(2) the positions of people meaning the two sides of power and the reason behind a noble man placing him right in the
center of the painting .</p>

<p>This has taught me the apprieceation of the art world. Being creative is wornderful but using putting in meaning
behind the creativeness is much more genuine. I believe the reason for museum is to look at art is too look at the color 
or the height or even see the famous painting everyone is talking about. What I have realized is understanding the reason to 
why they made it, could it be a aproach to protest? Could it be a history that impacted the artist life? Or could it be an art 
that creates their way of expressing themselves?</p>
